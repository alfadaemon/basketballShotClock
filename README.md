# Basketball Shot Clock
Simple basketball shot-clock (24/14) in react-native

You can reset to 24 or 14 seconds, pause and restart the app. This app it will notify with a beep sound when 10 seconds are left.

This app was build with the need to handle the shot clock violations at our local gym since we don't have the 24/14 seconds shot clock in place.
